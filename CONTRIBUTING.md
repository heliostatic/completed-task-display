## Development Setup

See the [Development section](README.md#development) in the README for setup instructions.

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all code
- Follow existing code style and formatting
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add type annotations where helpful
- Avoid `any` types when possible

### Code Style

- **Indentation**: Use tabs (not spaces)
- **Quotes**: Use double quotes for strings
- **Semicolons**: Use semicolons
- **Line length**: Keep lines under 100 characters when reasonable
- **Comments**: Add comments for complex logic

Example:

```typescript
async toggleCompletedTaskView() {
	this.hiddenState = !this.hiddenState;
	document.body.toggleClass("hide-completed-tasks", this.hiddenState);
	this.statusBar.setText(
		this.hiddenState ? "Hiding Completed Tasks" : "Showing Completed Tasks",
	);
	await this.saveHiddenState();
}
```

### CSS

- Use meaningful class names
- Add comments for sections
- Follow existing formatting
- Use kebab-case for class names

Example:

```css
/* Hide completed tasks in preview mode */
body.hide-completed-tasks
	.markdown-preview-view
	ul
	> li.task-list-item.is-checked {
	display: none;
}
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing

Before submitting a PR, test your changes:

1. **Build the plugin**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Test in a development vault**:
   - Create a test note with various task types
   - Toggle completed tasks on/off
   - Test in both Reading and Edit modes
   - Restart Obsidian to test state persistence

3. **Test edge cases**:
   - Empty notes
   - Notes with only completed tasks
   - Notes with only uncompleted tasks
   - Mixed task statuses (if applicable)
   - Very long task lists

### Test Checklist

- [ ] Plugin loads without errors
- [ ] Ribbon button appears and works
- [ ] Command palette command works
- [ ] Status bar updates correctly
- [ ] State persists after restart
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Works in Reading mode
- [ ] Works in Edit/Live Preview mode
- [ ] Custom task statuses still visible (for task status changes)

## Commit Messages

Write clear, concise commit messages:

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- First line should be 50 characters or less
- Reference issues and PRs when relevant

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>: <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)

fix: only hide completed tasks [x], not all custom statuses

Previously, the plugin was hiding ALL task statuses except empty [ ],
including custom statuses like [?], [!], [/], etc.

Changed CSS selector to specifically target only [x] and [X].

Fixes #3, addresses #13 and #19
```
