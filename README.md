## Completed Task Display

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that allows you to toggle the display of completed tasks in markdown preview mode.

### Features
- Ribbon button to hide/show completed tasks globally.
- Settings to define exception symbols (source view) that are treated as NOT completed (e.g. `!` so `- [!]` stays visible).
